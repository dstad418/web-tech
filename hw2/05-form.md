Notes:

This was pretty straight forward. I think I got some more experiences/familiarity with bootstrap classes,
(btn-primary/secondary, etc.). And since the CSS was so small I was able to include it in a style bracket
instead of its own file. I didn't see anything in the style guides (AirB&B and Clean Code) that forbade
CSS in HTML, although I know people have preferences- otherwise, straight forward assignment!
POST TUESDAY-CLASS NOTE: Nothing in the instructions required the output to be formatted like what was shown
during hte demonstration, mine just outputs to console log.

Notes:

I've been doing a lot of embedded typescript programming, and passing embedded values to SQL databases
recently, so this was a good refresher to work with it in a 'fun' way.
I had a lot of trouble with the colors, and I think WAVE/lighthouse wasn't able to give me a solid
score on my accesibility due to the pages being dynamic. I am also _very_ colorblind, so some of the
color changes for me didn't seem too drastic, so i'm probably the worst person to visually guess accesibility
needs. But I think it turned out pretty good!
